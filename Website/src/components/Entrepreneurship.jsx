              The Delhi Skill and Entrepreneurship University (DSEU) was
              established in August 2020 by the Government of NCT of Delhi
              (GNCTD) to equip students with world-class skill education to
              enable access to aspirational jobs, inculcate an entrepreneurial
              mindset and entrepreneurship. Entrepreneurship is an integral
              part of DSEU's vision and mission. Coming up with a new business
              idea is only a start; building a successful business around it is
              the challenge. Solving this challenge needs an entrepreneurial
              mindset, i.e., a person who is a voracious learner, has strong
              communication and problem-solving skills, with a high motivation
              to succeed, and yet open to risk and failure.
            </p>
            <p>
              To provide a platform to encourage and support entrepreneurial
              endeavors, GNCTD has set up an incubator, DSEU Innovation and
              Incubation Centre for Entrepreneurship (DIICE). DIICE has been set
              up as a Section 8 Company with its own independent Board of
              Directors. To streamline all entrepreneurship and incubation
              activities at DSEU, a consolidation of all incubation programs
              under the various campuses of DSEU was proposed under one
              incubator model premise, including programs like Foundation's
              BUNI, promoted by Bhai Parmanand DSEU Shakarpur campus. Other such
              programs are also in the process of being consolidated.
